# Load packages

```{r}
#| label: load_packages
#| echo: true
#| results: 'hide'
#| message: false
#| warning: false

##### Load packages for this assignment, do this every time
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggpubr)
library(viridis)

```

# Load data
```{r}
#| label: read_data

# Load saved NHANES homework dataset from the project files. This is the dataset we built in homework 2
load(here(("nhanes_homework_dataset.rda")), verbose = TRUE)
```


# 1. Create a scatterplot with a line of best fit

### Create a scatter plot with poverty-income ratio (variable: INDFMPIR) on the x-axis and digit symbol substitution test (variable: CFDDS) on the y-axis. Add a line of best fit for this relationship.

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot
#| warning: false

# Add a linear fit
ggplot(nhanes_homework,
       aes(x = INDFMPIR,
           y = CFDDS)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5,
             color = "seagreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Poverty to income ratio",
       y = "Digit Symbol Substition Test score",
       title = "Scatterplot of poverty income ratio by digit symbol substitution test")

```

Interpret the figure: Yes, there does appear to be a relationship between poverty to income ratio and digit symbol substitution test score. Higher values of poverty to income ratio have  higher digit symbol substitution test scores.


# 2. Create a bar plot 

### Create a bar plot where cognitive impairment status (variable: MCI) is on the x-axis and the bar fill is by race/ethnicity (variable: race_eth). Try updating the bar colors. 

```{r}
#| label: barplot
#| warning: false

# Optional, drop the participants with missing cognition values
nhanes_cognition <- nhanes_homework %>%
  drop_na(MCI)

# Make the bar plot
ggplot(nhanes_cognition,
       aes(x = MCI,
           fill = race_eth)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Barplot by race/ethnicity and cognitive status",
       x = "Cognitive impairment status",
       y = "Number of Participants",
       fill = "Race/ethnicity of participant") + 
  scale_fill_brewer() 

```

Interpret the figure: There appears to be a higher proportion of Non-Hispanic White participants in the no impairment category relative to the mild cognitive impairment category.


# 3. Create a histogram or density plot

### Make a histogram or density plot with the digit symbol substitution test score (variable: CFDDS) on the x-axis. Have the fill and/or color of the plot by category of educational attainment.

```{r}
#| label: histogram_density_plot
#| warning: false

# Optional, drop participants missing education
nhanes_education <- nhanes_homework %>%
  drop_na(education)

# Overlapping histograms
ggplot(nhanes_education,
       aes(x = CFDDS,
           fill = education,
           y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5,
                 position = "identity", #default position is stack 
                 alpha = 0.2)  +
  geom_density(aes(color = education),
               alpha = 0) +
  labs(x = "Digit Symbol Substitution Test Score",
       y = "Proportion of participants",
       title = "Histogram of cognition score by educational attainment",
       fill = "Educational attainment",
       color = "Educational attainment")

```

Interpret the figure: Within each educational attainment group, the distribution of digit symbol substitution score is relatively normally distributed. 



# 4. Create a boxplot or violin plot

### Make a boxplot or violin plot with the digit symbol substitution test score (variable: CFDDS) on the y-axis. Split the boxes or violins by the age group (variable: age_group) on the x-axis. Try filling the boxes with the color of your choice

```{r}
#| label: boxplot
#| warning: false

# Boxplot split by age groups
ggplot(nhanes_homework,
       aes(x = age_groups,
           y = CFDDS)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(x = "Age group",
       y= "Digit Symbol Substitution Test score",
       title = "Boxplot of cognition score by age group")


```

Interpret the figure: Yes, there does appear to be a relationship between age group and digit symbol substitution test. Higher age gropus have lower digit symbol substitution test scores. 



# 5. Create a multipaneled plot

### Create a multipaneled plot containing each of the previous plots from questions 1-4 (a barplot, a histogram, a boxplot or violin plot, and a scatterplot)

```{r}
#| label: multiplaneled
#| warning: false

scatter <- ggplot(nhanes_homework,
       aes(x = INDFMPIR,
           y = CFDDS)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5,
             color = "seagreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Poverty to income ratio",
       y = "Digit Symbol Substition Test score",
       title = "Scatterplot of poverty income ratio by digit symbol substitution test")

bar <- ggplot(nhanes_cognition,
       aes(x = MCI,
           fill = race_eth)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Barplot by race/ethnicity and cognitive status",
       x = "Cognitive impairment status",
       y = "Number of Participants",
       fill = "Race/ethnicity of participant") + 
  scale_fill_brewer() 

hist <- ggplot(nhanes_education,
       aes(x = CFDDS,
           fill = education,
           y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5,
                 position = "identity", #default position is stack 
                 alpha = 0.2)  +
  geom_density(aes(color = education),
               alpha = 0) +
  labs(x = "Digit Symbol Substitution Test Score",
       y = "Proportion of participants",
       title = "Histogram of cognition score by educational attainment",
       fill = "Educational attainment",
       color = "Educational attainment")

box <- ggplot(nhanes_homework,
       aes(x = age_groups,
           y = CFDDS)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(x = "Age group",
       y= "Digit Symbol Substitution Test score",
       title = "Boxplot of cognition score by age group")



ggarrange(scatter, bar, hist, box, 
          nrow = 2, 
          ncol = 2)
```

Interpret the figure: The histogram of cognition score by educational attainment is in the lower left hand corner.
